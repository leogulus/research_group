I am an astrophysicist with a dedicated focus on extragalactic astronomy, particularly specializing in a specific category of objects known as "galaxy clusters." Through a combination of multi-wavelength observations, encompassing optical, infrared, millimeter, and X-ray data, I investigate the intricacies of galaxy cluster formation and evolution. My research integrates data from an array of ground-based and space-based telescopes, allowing me the opportunity to characterize the dynamical state, thermodynamic structure, and cosmological significance of these remarkable objects.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
