This past week, I had the opportunity to serve as a lecturer at the Machine Learning in Astronomy Workshop held at NARIT Headquarters in Chiang Mai from August 27 to 29, 2025. The workshop also featured Aj. Thanawuth Thanathibodee and Aj. Thiparat Chotibut, who covered the introduction to astronomy data access and advanced machine learning methods in astronomy, respectively.

On the second day, I led the session on statistics in astronomy and demonstrated how to fit complex models to data using MCMC techniques. The morning session consisted mostly of lectures on the basics of Bayesian statistics, accompanied by a simple exercise on fitting a linear dataset. In the afternoon, participants tackled two challenging problems: one involving curve fitting and the other a double Gaussian fit with multiple parameters. The participants were highly engaged and enthusiastic about completing the exercises within the allotted time.

I also learned a lot from the other two sessions I attended, including how to use TOPCAT to access catalog data and neural network techniques for galaxy classification. Additionally, I had the chance to bring several Chulalongkorn University students, both undergraduates and masterâ€™s students, to join the workshop and gain hands-on experience with these techniques.
