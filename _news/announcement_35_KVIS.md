Last week, I had the chance to visit [Kamnoetvidya Science Academy (KVIS)](https://www.kvis.ac.th/) for the first time. Located in Rayong Province, about three hours from Bangkok, the school sits quietly among the mountains, surrounded by wide stretches of greenery that give the campus a calm and focused atmosphere.

I was invited to serve as a judge in the physics section of [the Invitational Science Fair 2026](https://app.kvis.ac.th/isf2026/). What stood out most was not just the beautiful setting, but the students. High school participants from several countries presented their research projects with impressive depth, clarity, and confidence. The level of dedication and effort behind each project was remarkable. Many of the students demonstrated not only strong technical understanding, but also genuine curiosity and ownership of their work. It was easy to imagine them continuing on this path and becoming excellent scientists and researchers in the years ahead.
