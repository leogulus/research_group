This year, I had the opportunity to serve as an invited speaker and session chair at the 20th Siam Physics Congress (SPC2025), held at Pullman Khon Kaen Raja Orchid and hosted by Khon Kaen University. This marked my second time attending this national physics conference in Thailand in person.

My invited talk was titled “SPT-CL J0417-4748: A Case of a Relaxed Galaxy Cluster Lacking Central Star Formation.” It was also the first time my students, both an undergraduate working on a senior thesis and a master’s student, had the chance to give oral presentations at the conference. SPC2025 is an excellent platform for students to present their research results in a professional setting, providing an invaluable opportunity to develop communication skills early in their scientific careers.

You can check out the slides from my presentation [here](https://leogulus.github.io/research_group/assets/pdf/Slide_SPC2025_compressed.pdf) for more details.
