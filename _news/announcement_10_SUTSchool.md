I had the privilege of teaching at the Astrophysics and Cosmology Summer School at Suranaree University of Technology on May 11th-12th, 2024. This program aims to immerse 3rd and 4th-year students in the wonders of extragalactic astronomy, guided by experts from various institutions. During the event, I delivered a dynamic 3-hour lecture titled "Galaxy Clusters: Exploring Diverse Aspects through Multiwavelength Studies." I'm excited to share the PDF of my lecture [here](assets/pdf/Taweewat_SUT2024_Astro_Summer_School.pdf), hoping it will be a valuable resource for future enthusiasts!
