The Chula Astro team (Atom and I), in collaboration with Aj. Surapong Yuma from Mahidol University, organized the JWST CU-MU Workshop 2024 on September 27-28, 2024, for undergraduate students. The workshop focused on how to use JWST data for astrophysics research. It stemmed from my experience attending the JWST Data Analysis and Processing Workshop in Chiang Mai over the summer. This was the first workshop I organized at Chula, marking a promising start for future astrophysics research activities here.

The workshop topics included an overview of JWST and its instruments [slides](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/evd19932hqhnecds8j0gb/20240927_Taweewat_JWST-Overview-2024.pdf?rlkey=2wbs07e513fmpqs4s4c24kh58&dl=0), JWST data reduction and processing, an introduction to imaging data analysis, and an introduction to spectral data analysis. Overall, the workshop was a great success, setting the stage for more collaborative events to advance astrophysics research in the region.
