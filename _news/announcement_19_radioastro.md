Today, I had the pleasure of hosting an educational event on “Transient Phenomena in Radio Astronomy,” featuring two distinguished speakers: Dr. Chompon Wongpethakson (Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Würzburg) and Dr. Phruekrit Charoenchittichai (Researcher, National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand - NARIT). They shared their expertise in the exciting, rapidly advancing field of radio astronomy, along with insights into Thailand’s 40-meter radio telescope in Chiang Mai.

The turnout was fantastic, with every seat filled. Freshmen and sophomores, in particular, showed great interest as they explore various topics in astronomy. A note to my future self: next time, let’s book a bigger room!
