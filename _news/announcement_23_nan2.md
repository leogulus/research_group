This past weekend, I had the opportunity to join another research trip to promote tourism in the Yod District of Nan Province. This time, we set up stargazing booths for tourists who traveled with us.  

The research project, led by Assist. Prof. Dr. Thitirat Panbamrungkij from the Faculty of Arts at Chulalongkorn University, focuses on creating new avenues for local communities in the area. Stargazing has the potential to become an additional activity that tourists can enjoy during their visit.
