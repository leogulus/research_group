I had the opportunity to be an invited speaker at the 19th Siam Physics Congress 2024 (SPC2024), held at the Royal River Hotel in Ayutthaya and hosted by King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL). This was my first time attending this national physics conference in Thailand in person.

The title of my invited talk was "CHIPS1911+4455: A Cooling Flow in a Merging Cluster." In addition, I also had the chance to chair one of the astronomy sessions. This event provided a fantastic opportunity to connect with many physicists from across the country, both new acquaintances and familiar faces. It also served as a platform for students—ranging from high school to graduate levels—to present their work to a large audience. It was inspiring to see the innovative research students are currently pursuing.
