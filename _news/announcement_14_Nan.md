I visited the Yod district in Nan province with Assist. Prof. Dr. Thitirat Panbamrungkij from Chulalongkorn University to help organize star-gazing events for the local community. This initiative was part of a pilot study for a creative tourism project aimed at making the area more tourism-friendly. We offered star-gazing activities with a small telescope and guided tours of the night sky. The feedback from attendees has been overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing their enjoyment and newfound knowledge of the night sky.
