Today, I had the opportunity to teach the basics of stargazing to over 200 fifth-grade students at Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Elementary School, a nearby local school. During the hour-long session, I introduced them to our solar system, highlighted famous planets like Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, and taught them the basics of using star charts. It was definitely a challenge to manage such a large group, and I’ll need to improve my time management for next time!
