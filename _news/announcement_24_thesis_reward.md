Today, I had the honor of receiving a PhD thesis award from Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn at Thailand Inventors' Day 2025 at BITEC Bangna. The award recognizes my PhD research at MIT with Prof. Michael McDonald, titled *"Searching for Extreme-BCG Clusters at 0.2 < z < 1.3,"* which I completed in 2021.  

This achievement would not have been possible without the incredible support of my thesis advisor. Thank you!
