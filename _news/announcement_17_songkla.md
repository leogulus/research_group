I spent an entire day in Songkla Province, in Southern Thailand, teaching high school teachers astronomy topics they can use to prepare their students for Olympiad competitions. The subjects I covered focused primarily on the Milky Way, galactic physics, and included several example problems. This experience was invaluable, as I had the opportunity to share my astronomy knowledge with many teachers, amplifying the impact on countless students in the years to come.

Here are the lecture notes I used during the session [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/eth7alhczonzpxc7b33hj/20240906_Taweewat_Highschool_Lecture.pdf?rlkey=yppoxfki8ff9dkjkb3hzid1nr&dl=0).
