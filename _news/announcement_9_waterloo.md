I attended the McNamara@65 conference at the University of Waterloo to celebrate the 65th birthday of Brian McNamara, a pioneer in the field of galaxy cluster feedback. This was my first visit to Canada and Toronto. I delivered a talk titled "CHIPS1911+4455: A Cooling Flow in a Merging Cluster," with the slides available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sa98g83ivyuyoxamxz3qn/Taweewat_Waterloo-Talk_-CHIPS1911-Taweewat-Somboonpanyakul.pdf?rlkey=ort72r0zlu3no5z3qao0k64m7&dl=0). The conference provided an excellent opportunity to engage with leading experts and connect with emerging scientists working on related topics. Attending focused conferences like this is invaluable for deepening expertise in the field. I extend my gratitude to the [Waterloo Centre for Astrophysics](https://uwaterloo.ca/astrophysics-centre/) for supporting my travel expenses.
