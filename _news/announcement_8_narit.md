I organized and supervised a weekend field trip for students from my class (2304275 Astro Tech) and others to visit both the radio observatory and the national telescope observatory in Chiang Mai. The trip aimed to provide hands-on experience and insight into the observation of astronomical objects using real telescopes. A special thanks to Aj. Wiphu Rujopakarn for guiding us during the trip.
