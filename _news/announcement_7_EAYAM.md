I had the privilege of delivering a presentation titled "Why and How Do We Study Relaxed Galaxy Clusters?" as part of the East Asian Young Astronomers Meeting (EAYAM) 2024 in Chiang Mai, Bangkok. It was a truly remarkable experience, connecting with numerous young astronomers from diverse Asian countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, and many others. I am eagerly looking forward to initiating collaborations with these newfound colleagues in the days ahead.
