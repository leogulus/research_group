Another year of teaching astronomy to future high school teachers has come to an end.

One of my favorite parts of the course is bringing my university students to a local high school to learn about telescopes, both the theory and the hands on practice. What makes it special is that the high school students, who regularly work with the telescopes, take the lead in teaching. They are confident, experienced, and more than ready to share what they know. This year, we visited twice, which gave us more time to review the material and practice with the instruments in greater depth. I always enjoy seeing students from different generations learn together and exchange knowledge so naturally.
