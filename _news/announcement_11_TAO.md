I had the opportunity to co-lead a team of high school students at the 21st Thailand Astronomy Olympiad (TAO21) held at Mahidol Wittayanusorn School (MWIT) in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. Visiting my alma mater after many years was a delightful experience. 

For those unfamiliar with TAO, it is a prestigious science competition that selects Thai high school students to compete in the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA). Before the competition, students from across the country engage in intensive astronomy training. I had the privilege of being one of these students in the past.

The first photo captures the opening ceremony at MWIT on the first day. The third photo shows the team leaders deliberating on the scoring criteria for each student. The last photo features an exquisite award plaque, designed and crafted by MWIT students, given to participants in this competition.
