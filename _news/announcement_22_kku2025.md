Today, I had the fantastic opportunity to give a two-hour lecture on *"Unlocking the Cosmos: How Data Science Powers the Latest Discoveries in Astrophysics"* at Khon Kaen University in Khon Kaen Province, in northeastern Thailand. I also got to spend the first day on a quick tour of the city, visiting some famous landmarks.  

The lecture was well attended by students from both the Statistics and Physics departments, thanks to the help of Aj. Orrarujee Muanwong from the Physics Department in recruiting participants. Overall, it was a great trip, and I’m looking forward to returning later this year for the Siam Physics Congress (SPC)!
