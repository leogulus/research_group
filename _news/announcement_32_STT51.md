From November 11 to 13, 2025, the 51st International Congress on Science, Technology and Technology based Innovation (STT51) was held at Chulalongkorn University. STT51 is a major multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers across a broad range of fields, from physics and astronomy to chemistry, biology, and applied sciences, providing a platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

This event marked my first experience serving as a symposium chair, where I was responsible for organizing the astrophysics symposium. My duties included inviting speakers, coordinating reviewers for submitted abstracts and proceedings, and overseeing the overall structure and flow of the symposium sessions. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, offering valuable insight into the organization of large academic conferences.

I am deeply grateful to my co chairs for their invaluable support throughout the process, including Dr. Nicha Leethochawalit, Dr. Krittapas Chanchaiworawit from NARIT, and Dr. Thanawuth Thanathibodee from Chulalongkorn University. I also sincerely thank all the invited speakers, Prof. Dr. David Ruffolo, Dr. Yuhiko Aoyama, Dr. Waraporn Nuntiyakul, Dr. Teeraparb Chantavat, and Dr. Samaporn Tinyanont, whose excellent contributions and engaging presentations played a key role in the success of the astrophysics symposium.
