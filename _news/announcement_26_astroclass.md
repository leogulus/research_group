This post marks the end of my first time teaching an astronomy course for education students‚Äîfuture high school teachers who will one day teach astronomy themselves. It was also my first time teaching an entire course on my own, from start to finish, including preparing all the materials and designing the structure of the class.

I had a lot of fun coming up with different activities and assignments for each topic we covered, from the celestial sphere and the solar system to galaxies and cosmology. One of the highlights of the course was a field trip to a nearby high school, where my students got hands-on experience learning how to use telescopes. The session was hosted by middle and high school students, which made it especially rewarding. It was wonderful to see the interaction between the younger students and the university students, learning from each other in a shared environment.

Overall, it was a great start to a course I‚Äôll be teaching again next year‚Äîand I‚Äôm already looking forward to improving and expanding it.
