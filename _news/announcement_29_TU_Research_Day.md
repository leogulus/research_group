Today, I had the opportunity to serve as a judge for an oral presentation contest for high school science projects in physical science at Triam Udom Suksa School, conveniently located right next door to my office. It was fascinating to see so many innovative projects from students in Grades 10 to 12, covering a wide range of topicsâ€”from improving bird nesting for harvesting, to studying temple orientations according to the stars, to converting cocoa fruit waste into valuable chemicals. I was truly impressed by the level of effort and creativity these students demonstrated.

In addition to judging, I had the chance to speak with the participating students, sharing stories and experiences with those who aspire to become scientists in the future. It was incredibly rewarding to inspire the next generation through an event like this and to see their excitement for scientific exploration.
