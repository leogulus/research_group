This week, our group traveled to Chiang Mai to use the 2.4-meter Thai National Telescope near Doi Inthanon for student projects. Although Iâ€™ve visited the telescope many times before, this was my first time actually operating it for observationsâ€”and spending both nights up at the observatory.

The first night was uneventful due to persistent cloud cover. Fortunately, the second night was nearly perfect. Despite a few clouds, we managed to collect as much data as possible. I also took a moment to capture some night sky photos of the Milky Way next to the telescope.

Overall, it was a fun and refreshing experience to spend the night observing againâ€”something I used to do often during my PhD. That said, Iâ€™m starting to wonder if I can still pull all-nighters like I used to!
