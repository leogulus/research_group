From December 12 to 14, 2025, I served as one of the organizers of the Night at the Museum event at Chulalongkorn University. The event was part of a public outreach initiative aimed at bringing astronomy closer to students and the general public through hands on nighttime observations and informal science communication.

Over the three nights, the event was successful, with many visitors joining telescope sessions to observe Saturn, Jupiter, and the Pleiades star cluster under favorable sky conditions. The strong public interest and enthusiastic participation highlighted the impact of astronomy outreach activities and made the event a rewarding experience for everyone involved.
